<!-- Although I was provided with the option to code images that were already given to me, I decided to take my time and get started on a website I've been meaning to make for people who need a safe space and a place to express themselves personally and anonymously. I don't want this to be a place where you can see when people like something or repost something. Aside from this, adding several types of music and cool visuals to aid it would be nice, but I would probably need to incorporate javascript to make it work. Anyway this was really fun to make and I hope to get better at it -->

As someone who tends to get overwhelmed, sometimes we need to relax and say what we need to say. Even if it is not directly at someone. You may direct your message and send it off to the galaxy either anonymously or not. Keep it sweet, or bittersweet if it needs to be. I hope this helps as your journal or safe space. Be safe and thank you!</p>
